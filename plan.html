<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Abel Lim Wee Kiat<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> http://jc479367.studentweb.jcu.edu.sg</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The Cossie Play website is intended to garner interest about cosplay among young adults and encourage them to take advantage of services provided by Cossie Play.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Assuming all other forms of advertisment stay consistant, the number of participents between the age of 16 - 30 attending Cossie Play's monthly cosplay parties is expected to increase by a significant margin. Under the same conditions, the number of costume commissions each month from the same demographic is also expected to increase. If both expectations are met, we can consider the implementation of the website a success.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Primarily high schoolers to young adults (Ages between 16 - 29 years old) who are not yet into cosplaying.</p>
